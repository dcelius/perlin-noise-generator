# perlin-noise-generator

Dylan Celius

ppm_maker takes in the filename of an input file to generate a ppm file with the corresponding specifications. 

imsize [width] [height]
seed [any integer]

imsize is required, seed is not. 
The general output should be a picture with a random color based on the seed, and a random amount of bloom also based on the seed - the distance formula is applied to each pixel from the center, and a ratio based on the seed is applied to the color elements of the pixel adjusting intensity of the pixel.
An image generated by the seed is unique to that seed, and should generate the same every time.
If a seed is invalid or not provided, a random seed is used instead.

The program can be compiled using:
g++ -o ppm_maker ppm_maker.cpp

The program can be run using:
./ppm_maker [input file]
